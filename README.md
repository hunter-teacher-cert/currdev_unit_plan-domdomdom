# JavaScript DOM
by Lyuba Fridman (in collaboration with Brian Mueller and Daiana Munoz)

-----

## General Overview
This unit on JavaScript DOM will be taught after HTML and CSS in order to give students the skills they need to build functional web apps. This will also set up a foundation for working with JavaScript libraries such as React or JQuery. 

### Pre-requisites: 
- basic knowledge of JavaScript: variables, if statements, etc. these basic concepts will be taught during a previous unit on game design. 
- Thorough knowledge of HTML/CSS.
---

## Motivation for Unit
Students should learn vanilla JavaScript before working with any libraries that abstract away details so that their skills are flexible and they are not dependent on one particular library.

---

## Standards Referenced
(select one of the standards sets reviewed in class (CSTA, NY, MA, RI), include a link and a brief explanation as to why you selected that set)

---

## Tools Used
- HTML/CSS/JS
- repl.it IDE
- Google Docs for digital notes
