- Khan Academy had pre-made lessons on JS DOM. The lessons provide debugging support for students and allow for differentiation in the form of self-pacing.
- Repl.it Teams is an IDE with collaboration features. It includes the ability for teachers to provide instructions in a markdown file that students can view side by side with their code. It is currently paid for by my school.
- Google slides is a presentation tool. It is cloud-based, easy to use, and integrates well with other tools like Nearpod.
- Nearpod allows for student engagement with presentations. It is a good way to do formative assessment. I use it to replace paper formative assessment tools such as worksheets.
